## Project Description: CourseFlow (Online Class Management System)

Ref: https://www.vidyalayaschoolsoftware.com/products-services/online-classroom

This is my final group project from TechUp's Full-Stack Software Development bootcamp. It facilitates classroom management for both admins and users. For admins, they can organize homework distribution, curriculum management, homework grading and tracking, and document filing. Meanwhile, users can see all available class contents and materials, subscribe/unsubscribe classes, turn in their homework/projects, and view their performances.

## Key Features:

**As users, they:**

1. can create their student profile upon registration, with the following details:
    - Full Name
    - Age
    - Educational Background
    - Email
    - Password
2. can view/edit their profile.
3. can upload their profile picture.
4. can log into and log out from their profiles with email.
5. can view all available courses.
6. can view a course, including:
    - Course details
    - Module samples
    - Subscription Options
7. can individually subscribe/unsubscribe desired courses in their course list. 
8. can search for courses with search filter using keywords.
9. can view their subscribed courses with full content details and accept assignments in My Course.
